    "A geometric progression / series is the sum of a geometric sequence.\n",

    "A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers that scale by a common ratio, usually denoted as r. To get the next term, multiply the current term by this value. The first term is provided for this kata.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first 4 terms of the geometric sequence with first term 2 and ratio 3 is 2, 6, 18, 54. Notice that, given any term, it is 3 times larger than the last term for this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "A geometric series is just the first n terms of the sequence summed together. For instance, the sum of the first four terms of the example provided above is \n",
